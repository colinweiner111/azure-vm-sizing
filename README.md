# Azure VM Sizing Guide

Decode Azure Virtual Machine naming conventions and understand what all those letters and numbers actually mean. Learn how to read VM names like `D16ds_v5` and `E32as_v6`, understand the difference between families, series, and sizes, and choose the right VM configuration for your workloads. This presentation cuts through the complexity of the Azure VM ecosystem, helping you make informed decisions about compute resources, avoid common pitfalls, and optimize both performance and cost.
